Shop Incognito
==============
A Chrome extension that turns off Amazon browsing history &mdash; and keeps it off.

Amazon lets you disable your browsing history, but they store the setting in a cookie, even if you're signed in. So whenever your Amazon session expires (e.g., you clear your cookies), your preference is lost. This extension watches for new Amazon sessions and disables browsing history on your behalf.
